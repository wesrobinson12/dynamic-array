# Dynamic Array and Ring Buffer

The purpose of this project was to rebuild Ruby's `Array` class from scratch, including a simple static array, dynamic array, and ring buffer (with resizing).  Functionality includes push, pop, shift, unshift, and resize!.  

To try it out, simply clone the repository, open up your IRB and load the file, and create a new array using `arr = RingBuffer.new`.
